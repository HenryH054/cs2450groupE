# User Stories
## User Story 1

As an instructor, I want a extremely simplified version of assembly instructions so that students are able to learn the fundamentals of assembly without having to learn the x86 instruction set.

## User Story 2

As a student, I want to learn the fundamentals of assembly while using a reliable emulator so that I am better able to understand the fundamentals of computing and can have a more holistic view of the world.
